===================================
JOB 10 - PROJECTILE SYSTEM DEMO
===================================

WHAT'S NEW:
- Projectile class (flying arrows)
- Bow creates arrow projectiles
- Arrows deal damage on collision
- Automatic projectile cleanup
- Visual feedback for ranged combat

TO RUN:
./campus_quest_projectiles

===================================
HOW PROJECTILES WORK
===================================

INSTANT HIT MODEL:
1. Player fires Bow
2. Arrow projectile created at player position
3. Arrow "flies" toward target (visual)
4. Arrow checks collision immediately
5. Arrow deals damage if hit
6. Arrow marked as expired
7. Arrow removed from game
All in ONE turn!

PROJECTILE LIFECYCLE:
Create → Process → Damage → Cleanup

===================================
BOW vs MELEE COMPARISON
===================================

BOW ATTACK (with Projectile):
---------------------------
Player: "Attack with Bow"
→ 🏹 Firing arrow at Goblin!
→ 💨 Arrow flies through the air...
→ 🎯 Arrow HITS Goblin! Deals 1 damage (HP: 30 → 29)
→ [Cleanup] Removed 1 expired projectile(s)

SWORD ATTACK (melee, no projectile):
-----------------------------------
Player: "Attack with Sword"
→ ⚔️ Sword slash! Deals 4 damage to Goblin (HP: 29 → 25)

DIFFERENCE:
- Bow = Creates visible projectile object
- Sword = Direct damage application
- Same result, different feel!

===================================
TESTING SCENARIOS
===================================

SCENARIO 1: BOW ATTACK SEQUENCE
-------------------------------
Turn 1:
  [2] Attack (with Bow equipped)
  → Arrow created
  → Arrow hits target
  → Target takes 1 damage
  → Arrow removed

Verify: Target health reduced by 1

SCENARIO 2: WEAPON COMPARISON
-----------------------------
Turn 1: Equip Bow, attack
  → Projectile created
  → "🏹 Firing arrow..."
  → "🎯 Arrow HITS..."

Turn 2: Switch to Sword, attack
  → No projectile
  → "⚔️ Sword slash!"
  → Direct damage

SCENARIO 3: MULTIPLE ARROWS
---------------------------
Turn 1: Attack with Bow → Arrow 1 created
Turn 2: Attack with Bow → Arrow 2 created
Turn 3: Attack with Bow → Arrow 3 created

Each arrow:
- Hits target
- Deals 1 damage
- Gets cleaned up

SCENARIO 4: PROJECTILE CLEANUP
------------------------------
Watch cleanup phase:
  [CLEANUP PHASE]
  🏹 Removed 1 expired projectile(s)

Automatic memory management!

===================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
===================================

PROJECTILE PROPERTIES:
- Damage: Same as weapon power (Bow = 1)
- Owner: Player who fired it
- Target: Character being attacked
- HasHit: Tracks if already dealt damage

COLLISION DETECTION:
- Projectile at player position
- Target at enemy position
- Distance check (collision detection)
- If hit: apply damage

CLEANUP:
- After projectile.update(), hasHit = true
- Cleanup phase calls removeExpiredProjectiles()
- unique_ptr automatically deletes projectile
- No memory leaks!

===================================
GAME DESIGN IMPLICATIONS
===================================

BOW IS NOW UNIQUE:
- Only ranged weapon with projectiles
- Feels different from melee
- Visual distinction (arrow effects)
- Strategic choice

RANGED COMBAT FEEL:
- "Firing" vs "Slashing"
- Arrow flight (even if instant)
- Distinct visual feedback
- More cinematic

FUTURE EXTENSIONS:
- Multi-turn arrow flight
- Dodging arrows (move out of path)
- Different projectile types
- Projectile speed/travel time
- Area-of-effect projectiles

===================================
ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS
===================================

DESIGN PATTERNS:
✓ Factory Pattern (createObject<Projectile>)
✓ Object Pool (could add reusable arrows)
✓ Strategy Pattern (Bow creates projectiles)
✓ Composite Pattern (Projectile is GameObject)

MODERN C++ FEATURES:
✓ Smart pointers (automatic cleanup)
✓ Dynamic cast (type checking)
✓ Lambda expressions (cleanup filter)
✓ RAII (resource management)

GAME DEVELOPMENT:
✓ Projectile systems (arrows, bullets)
✓ Weapon differentiation (ranged vs melee)
✓ Hit detection (collision-based)
✓ Lifecycle management (spawn, update, destroy)

===================================

ENJOY FIRING ARROWS! 🏹
