JOB 09 - COLLISION DETECTION DEMO
===================================

WHAT'S NEW:
- Objects cannot pass through each other
- Distance-based collision (0.5 unit radius)
- Player movement blocked by collisions
- Enemy AI respects collisions
- Decor acts as obstacles

TO RUN:
./campus_quest_collisions

===================================
COLLISION SCENARIOS TO TEST
===================================

SCENARIO 1: PLAYER BLOCKED BY ENEMY
------------------------------------
Turn 1:
  Initial: Player (0,0), Goblin (5,0)
  Action: Choose [1] Move
  Direction: D (right)
  Distance: 6
  Result: ❌ COLLISION! Movement blocked by Goblin
  Player stays at (0,0)

WHY: Moving to (6,0) would put player within 0.5 units of Goblin at (5,0)
Distance: 6-5 = 1, but Goblin will have moved closer!

SCENARIO 2: PLAYER BLOCKED BY DECOR
------------------------------------
Turn 1:
  Initial: Player (0,0), Tree (3,3)
  Action: Choose [1] Move
  Direction: W (up)
  Distance: 3
  Then: Choose [1] Move again
  Direction: D (right)
  Distance: 3
  Result: ❌ COLLISION! Movement blocked by Ancient Tree
  
WHY: Moving to (3,3) would collide with tree at (3,3)

SCENARIO 3: ENEMY BLOCKED BY ANOTHER ENEMY
-------------------------------------------
Watch enemies in automated mode:
  Enemy 1 moves toward player
  Enemy 2 moves toward player
  If they get too close to each other:
  Result: ⚠️ Enemy blocked by collision
  
WHY: Enemies can't stack on top of each other

SCENARIO 4: STRATEGIC POSITIONING
----------------------------------
Use decor as cover:
  Move player BEHIND a tree
  Enemy tries to reach you but blocked by tree
  You can attack from safety!

===================================
COLLISION MECHANICS
===================================

COLLISION RADIUS: 0.5 units
- Objects within 0.5 units = COLLISION
- Distance > 0.5 units = NO COLLISION

COLLISION DETECTION:
1. Player tries to move to (newX, newY)
2. Check distance from (newX, newY) to ALL objects
3. If any distance < 0.5 → BLOCKED
4. Otherwise → MOVE ALLOWED

WHAT COLLIDES:
✓ Player vs Enemy (blocks)
✓ Player vs Decor (blocks)
✓ Enemy vs Enemy (blocks)
✓ Enemy vs Decor (blocks)
✓ Enemy vs Player (blocks - enemies can't walk through you!)

COLLISION FEEDBACK:
Player: "❌ COLLISION! Movement blocked by Goblin"
Enemy: "⚠️ Goblin blocked by collision"

===================================
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS
===================================

1. POSITIONING MATTERS
   - Can't just run away freely
   - Must navigate around obstacles

2. TERRAIN IS TACTICAL
   - Trees/rocks block movement
   - Use as cover or barriers

3. ENEMIES CAN BLOCK EACH OTHER
   - Creates interesting situations
   - "Traffic jams" of enemies!

4. CLOSE COMBAT IS FORCED
   - Can't avoid enemies forever
   - Must fight when cornered

===================================
TESTING CHECKLIST
===================================

□ Try to move through an enemy → Should be blocked
□ Try to move through a tree → Should be blocked
□ Watch enemies bump into each other → Should see collision messages
□ Move close to enemy (< 0.5) → Should trigger collision
□ Move away from enemies → Should work fine (no collision)
□ Attack enemy from distance → Should work (collision doesn't affect attacks)

===================================
TECHNICAL DETAILS
===================================

Algorithm: Distance-based Collision Detection
- O(n) per movement (check all objects)
- For 10 objects: ~10 distance calculations
- Fast enough for turn-based games

Formula: sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²) < 0.5

Implementation:
- GameManager::canMoveTo() - preventive checking
- GameManager::checkCollision() - direct check
- GameManager::getBlockingObject() - identify blocker

This is the SAME algorithm used in:
- Pokemon (collision with trainers, obstacles)
- Zelda (collision with walls, enemies)
- Strategy games (unit collision)

===================================

ENJOY TESTING COLLISIONS! 💥
